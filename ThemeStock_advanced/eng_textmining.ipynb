    "# Technological Advancements in Payments\n",
    "\n",
    "Text = \"\"\"\n",
    "Thank you for inviting me to speak today on payments innovation.1 It is an exciting time to work in payments. While I have always been interested in the topic, I would have never imagined decades ago that payments would generate this amount of enthusiasm, where now some of the coolest jobs in tech are working in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment system is experiencing what I have called a \"technology-driven revolution,\" where the latest advances in computing power, data processing, and distributed networks have fueled growth in innovative new payment services.2 This includes 24/7 instant payments, user-friendly digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and stablecoins and other digital assets. Alongside these new services sits enabling technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that has the potential to improve the precision and efficiency of the underlying payment products even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there has been a lot of excitement, and admittedly sometimes hype, around the possibilities of these new technologies, there have also been some who have been fearful or skeptical of innovation in this space. But we only have to look to history to see that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any payment transaction, three things happen. First, an object is bought and paid for with another object. Second, there is a technology for conducting this transaction. Finally, there is a technology for recording the history of the transaction and ownership of the objects. For example, I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple and use a digital dollar in my checking account to pay for it. I tap my debit card on a card reader to conduct the transaction. Finally, the machine prints out a receipt, which is the record of the transaction. The same process applies to the crypto world. I buy a meme coin and use a stablecoin as the means of payment. The transaction takes place using a smart contract. Finally, the transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger.3 There is nothing scary about this just because it occurs in the decentralized finance or defi world—this is simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions. There is nothing to be afraid of when thinking about using smart contracts, tokenization, or distributed ledgers in everyday transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technologies available today might be new, but leveraging innovative technology to build new payment services is not a new story. What I'd like to emphasize today is that the private and public sectors can both embrace innovation within their respective roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will recap how I generally approach these issues. I am a strong believer in the benefits of the free market. I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies. I also see firsthand the important role the Federal Reserve plays in fostering a payment and settlement system that is both safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements.4\n",
    "\n",
    "I would argue that broadly, there have been two models of payments innovation, which can be useful in characterizing the longer-term arc of payments evolution, as well as some recent developments. The first is private sector-driven innovation. As I have noted, this should be the default model. The second approach is where public sector entities like the Fed build platforms that enable the private sector to offer services to their customers. This should be done only rarely, and in instances where there is a specific market need. Both models are important in the payments ecosystem, and I'll walk through some historical and recent examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the first model of private sector-led innovation and use payment cards as an example. Early cards were metal plates or cardboard, then they incorporated magnetic strips, then chips, and now I tap my phone to pay. In the early days of consumer credit used for transactional purposes, privately operated card companies seized on the availability of new technology to support automated card authorizations and processing, continually upgrading over time, to build what are now global networks of interconnected banks that support the preferred payment method for consumers and many small businesses in the United States.5 Here, the private sector demonstrated its ability to effectively build a payment service that met the needs of consumers, all based on proprietary technology. Even still, card networks interact with the broader payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem, benefitting from Fed-operated payment infrastructures for settlement of interbank obligations.6\n",
    "\n",
    "Stablecoins are the latest example of private sector-led innovation in payments.7 The original use of stablecoins was to facilitate crypto trading. Crypto-asset prices can be volatile and as with any financial market, there is a need for traders to move out of relatively risky positions into safer ones with a stable asset price. As the stablecoin market matured, firms found that the properties of stablecoins using distributed ledger technology— including 24/7 availability, fast transferability, and their freely circulating nature —could be attractive for other use cases as well. That includes providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars, particularly in countries with high inflation or without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services. In fact, I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally. Stablecoins also have the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spoke about the maturing stablecoin market in February of this year, and, at the time, I noted the need for a regulatory regime for stablecoins in the U.S to provide regulatory clarity and reduce regulatory fragmentation for market participants.8 Last month, the GENIUS Act became the first major crypto-asset legislation to become law. This was an important step for the payment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential. Stablecoins, like card payments, are a private sector-driven innovation. And, like card payments, we see connections to the traditional payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem. For example, many stablecoin arrangements use legacy payment services to fund and redeem stablecoin balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to stablecoins, the use of AI in payments is an area where we are seeing significant private sector-led innovation. Here, AI is not serving as payments infrastructure but as an enabling technology that could bring considerable benefits to both private and public sector-operated payment services.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may surprise some to learn that, within the financial sector, the payments industry has long been at the forefront of AI adoption. This is true for several major waves of AI technology. Since the early 1990s, payment firms have used machine learning for things like detecting fraud and money laundering, or predicting payment flows and trends.9\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, as large language models and generative AI have matured, payments innovators have used the technology to further enhance fraud detection and compliance systems and to make the cumbersome process of reconciling payments files more accurate and efficient. Agentic AI systems, which operate autonomously by planning and executing multistep processes, appear to be the next wave of AI advancement. While agentic AI is still in its early days, payments innovators in the private sector are once again channeling the promise of this technology and rapidly building out various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's touch briefly on the second model of public sector innovation of payments infrastructures to support the private sector. Almost since its founding, the Federal Reserve has provided core clearing and settlement infrastructure to maintain the safety and efficiency of the payment system. The Fed has consistently upgraded the infrastructure over time using the latest available technology. For example, in the early 20th century, interbank transfers were effected through telegraph wires—an early version of Fedwire—then through emerging forms of electronic payment messages. Now fast-forward to this century where we have interbank payment systems that process transactions in real time.10 Banks, payment services providers, and even fintechs have used the infrastructure provided by the Fed to build payment services that their customers demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to demonstrate that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement. Much of this evolution has been led by private sector innovators. Key components have been supported by the Federal Reserve, either providing core infrastructure as a payment system operator or in convening the industry around specific solutions like payment standards.11 These complementary roles have led to a U.S. payment system that operates safely and efficiently and serves as a backbone for commerce in the U.S. and globally. That is why it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue to embrace technological advancements to modernize its services and continue to support private sector innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fed is also conducting technical research on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. As a payment system operator, it is important to understand trends in payments technology so that we can continue to support private sector firms that leverage our infrastructures, as well as understand whether emerging technologies could provide opportunities to improve our existing platforms and services. Finally, we engage with innovators like you to better understand new technologies and their potential to improve payments. In fact, it is my belief that the Federal Reserve could benefit from further engagement with innovators in industry, particularly as there is increased convergence between the traditional financial sector and the digital asset ecosystem. We are working on ways to further that engagement, so stay tuned.\n",

    "At “Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,” an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\n",
    "\n",
    "Share\n",
    "Watch Live\n",
    "Four and a half years after COVID-19's arrival, the worst of the pandemic-related economic distortions are fading. Inflation has declined significantly. The labor market is no longer overheated, and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before the pandemic. Supply constraints have normalized. And the balance of the risks to our two mandates has changed. Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path ahead for monetary policy. I will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the pandemic arrived, exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation, and why it has fallen so much while unemployment has remained low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Near-Term Outlook for Policy\n",
    "Let's begin with the current situation and the near-term outlook for policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight. The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary focus has been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. Prior to this episode, most Americans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation for a sustained period. Inflation brought substantial hardship, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. High inflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Our restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, with prices having risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months (figure 1).2 After a pause earlier this year, progress toward our 2 percent objective has resumed. My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to employment, in the years just prior to the pandemic, we saw the significant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market conditions: low unemployment, high participation, historically low racial employment gaps, and, with inflation low and stable, healthy real wage gains that were increasingly concentrated among those with lower incomes.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state. The unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3 percent—still low by historical standards, but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 (figure 2). Most of that increase has come over the past six months. So far, rising unemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs, as is typically the case in an economic downturn. Rather, the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the supply of workers and a slowdown from the previously frantic pace of hiring. Even so, the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable. Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year.4 Job vacancies have fallen, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to its pre-pandemic range. The hiring and quits rates are now below the levels that prevailed in 2018 and 2019. Nominal wage gains have moderated. All told, labor market conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019—a year when inflation ran below 2 percent. It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon. We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. But the inflation and labor market data show an evolving situation. The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased. As we highlighted in our last FOMC statement, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market. The current level of our policy rate gives us ample room to respond to any risks we may face, including the risk of unwelcome further weakening in labor market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rise and Fall of Inflation\n",
    "Let's now turn to the questions of why inflation rose, and why it has fallen so significantly even as unemployment has remained low. There is a growing body of research on these questions, and this is a good time for this discussion.5 It is, of course, too soon to make definitive assessments. This period will be analyzed and debated long after we are gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic led quickly to shutdowns in economies around the world. It was a time of radical uncertainty and severe downside risks. As so often happens in times of crisis, Americans adapted and innovated. Governments responded with extraordinary force, especially in the U.S. Congress unanimously passed the CARES Act. At the Fed, we used our powers to an unprecedented extent to stabilize the financial system and help stave off an economic depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a historically deep but brief recession, in mid-2020 the economy began to grow again. As the risks of a severe, extended downturn receded, and as the economy reopened, we faced the risk of replaying the painfully slow recovery that followed the Global Financial Crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congress delivered substantial additional fiscal support in late 2020 and again in early 2021. Spending recovered strongly in the first half of 2021. The ongoing pandemic shaped the pattern of the recovery. Lingering concerns over COVID weighed on spending on in-person services. But pent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions. Eight million people left the workforce at its onset, and the size of the labor force was still 4 million below its pre-pandemic level in early 2021. The labor force would not return to its pre-pandemic trend until mid-2023 (figure 3).6 Supply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers, disrupted international trade linkages, and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of demand (figure 4). Clearly, this was nothing like the slow recovery after the Global Financial Crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter inflation. After running below target through 2020, inflation spiked in March and April 2021. The initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad based, with extremely large price increases for goods in short supply, such as motor vehicles. My colleagues and I judged at the outset that these pandemic-related factors would not be persistent and, thus, that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass through fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response—in short, that the inflation would be transitory. Standard thinking has long been that, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, it can be appropriate for central banks to look through a temporary rise in inflation.7\n",
    "\n",
    "The good ship Transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and advanced-economy central bankers on board.8 The common expectation was that supply conditions would improve reasonably quickly, that the rapid recovery in demand would run its course, and that demand would rotate back from goods to services, bringing inflation down.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a time, the data were consistent with the transitory hypothesis. Monthly readings for core inflation declined every month from April to September 2021, although progress came slower than expected (figure 5). The case began to weaken around midyear, as was reflected in our communications. Beginning in October, the data turned hard against the transitory hypothesis.9 Inflation rose and broadened out from goods into services. It became clear that the high inflation was not transitory, and that it would require a strong policy response if inflation expectations were to remain well anchored. We recognized that and pivoted beginning in November. Financial conditions began to tighten. After phasing out our asset purchases, we lifted off in March 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "By early 2022, headline inflation exceeded 6 percent, with core inflation above 5 percent. New supply shocks appeared. Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp increase in energy and commodity prices. The improvements in supply conditions and rotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected, in part due to further COVID waves in the U.S.10 And COVID continued to disrupt production globally, including through new and extended lockdowns in China.11\n",
    "\n",
    "High rates of inflation were a global phenomenon, reflecting common experiences: rapid increases in the demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices.12 The global nature of inflation was unlike any period since the 1970s. Back then, high inflation became entrenched—an outcome we were utterly committed to avoiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mid-2022, the labor market was extremely tight, with employment increasing by over 6-1/2 million from the middle of 2021. This increase in labor demand was met, in part, by workers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade. But labor supply remained constrained, and, in the summer of 2022, labor force participation remained well below pre-pandemic levels. There were nearly twice as many job openings as unemployed persons from March 2022 through the end of the year, signaling a severe labor shortage (figure 6).13 Inflation peaked at 7.1 percent in June 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this podium two years ago, I discussed the possibility that addressing inflation could bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth. Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment.14 I expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring price stability and to keeping at it until the job is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FOMC did not flinch from carrying out our responsibilities, and our actions forcefully demonstrated our commitment to restoring price stability. We raised our policy rate by 425 basis points in 2022 and another 100 basis points in 2023. We have held our policy rate at its current restrictive level since July 2023 (figure 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "The summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation. The 4-1/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment—a welcome and historically unusual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, as well as severe shocks to energy and commodity markets, were important drivers of high inflation, and their reversal has been a key part of the story of its decline. The unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent disinflation. Our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand, which combined with improvements in aggregate supply to reduce inflationary pressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace. As labor demand also moderated, the historically high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has normalized primarily through a decline in vacancies, without sizable and disruptive layoffs, bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word on the critical importance of inflation expectations. Standard economic models have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when product and labor markets are balanced—without the need for economic slack—so long as inflation expectations are anchored at our objective. That's what the models said, but the stability of longer-run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a persistent burst of high inflation. It was far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold. Concerns over de-anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require slack in the economy and specifically in the labor market. An important takeaway from recent experience is that anchored inflation expectations, reinforced by vigorous central bank actions, can facilitate disinflation without the need for slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an extraordinary collision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrained supply. While researchers differ in their approaches and, to some extent, in their conclusions, a consensus seems to be emerging, which I see as attributing most of the rise in inflation to this collision.15 All told, the healing from pandemic distortions, our efforts to moderate aggregate demand, and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2 percent objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disinflation while preserving labor market strength is only possible with anchored inflation expectations, which reflect the public's confidence that the central bank will bring about 2 percent inflation over time. That confidence has been built over decades and reinforced by our actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is my assessment of events. Your mileage may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Let me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be unlike any other, and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary period. Our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every five years. As we begin this process later this year, we will be open to criticism and new ideas, while preserving the strengths of our framework. The limits of our knowledge—so clearly evident during the pandemic—demand humility and a questioning spirit focused on learning lessons from the past and applying them flexibly to our current challenges.\n",

    "that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and\n",

    "stockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs; slow pass-through of input cost increases into\n",

    "final goods and services prices; gradual updating of contract prices; maintenance of firm–customer\n",

    "magnitude of tariff effects on prices, a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that\n",
    "foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs, implying that domestic\n",
    "businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs. Several participants, drawing\n",

    "exerting more wage discipline, or exploiting cost-saving efficiency measures such as automation and\n",

    "great deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data, helping to inform their assessment\n",
    "of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate; at the same time, some\n",
    "noted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs’ effects on\n",
    "inflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Some participants stressed that the issue of\n",
    "the persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary\n",
    "policy. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may\n",
    "not be far above its neutral level; among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was\n",
    "the likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic\n",
    "activity.\n",
    "In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy,\n",
    "participants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment\n",
    "remained elevated. Participants noted that, if this year’s higher tariffs were to generate a larger-than-\n",
    "expected or a more-persistent-than-anticipated increase in inflation, or if medium- or longer-term\n",
    "inflation expectations were to increase notably, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more\n",
    "restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market\n",
    "conditions remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if\n",
    "inflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would\n",
    "be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the\n",
    "case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved\n",
    "to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened. Participants agreed that, if\n",
    "that situation were to occur, they would consider each variable’s distance from the Committee’s goal\n",
    "and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to\n",
    "close. Participants noted that, in this context, it was especially important to ensure that longer-term\n",
    "inflation expectations remained well anchored.\n",
    "Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Of those who\n",
    "commented, participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus\n",
    "far and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant. They agreed that, with reserves\n",
    "projected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit\n",
    "situation, it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate\n",
    "how close reserves were to their ample level. A few participants also assessed that, in this\n",
    "environment, abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days.\n",
    "They noted that, if such events created pressures in money markets, the Federal Reserve’s existing\n",
    "tools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target\n",
    "range. A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementation—as\n",

    "In support of the Committee’s goals, almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the\n",
    "federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for\n",
    "the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. These members judged that, excluding tariff\n",
    "effects, inflation was running close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that higher tariffs were\n",
    "unlikely to have persistent effects on inflation. Furthermore, they assessed that downside risk to\n",
    "employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and\n",
    "consumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions,\n",
    "including low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of\n",
    "industries that were less affected by the business cycle. Members agreed that in considering the\n",
    "extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the\n",
    "Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All\n",
    "members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to\n",
    "supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.\n",
    "Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would\n",
    "continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be\n",

    "into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation\n",
    "pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\n",
    "At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New\n",

    "The manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market-based\n",
    "measures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the\n",
    "intermeeting period, consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook\n",
    "and in policy rate expectations. Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed\n",

    "Regarding foreign exchange developments, the manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar\n",
    "index had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in\n",
    "recent intermeeting periods. At the same time, the manager noted that correlations between the\n",

    "relative stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets.\n",

    "that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and\n",

    "final goods and services prices; gradual updating of contract prices; maintenance of firm–customer\n",

    "foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs, implying that domestic\n",
    "businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs. Several participants, drawing\n",
    "on information provided by business contacts or business surveys, expected that many companies\n",
    "would increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end-customers over time. However, a few\n",

    "exerting more wage discipline, or exploiting cost-saving efficiency measures such as automation and\n",
    "new technologies. A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms’\n",

    "was important that they remain so. Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded\n",
    "2 percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer-term inflation\n",
    "expectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn-out effects of higher tariffs on inflation. A\n",

         "Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations\nThe manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period,\nthe expected path of the policy rate and longer-term Treasury yields were little changed, equity prices\nincreased, credit spreads narrowed, and the dollar depreciated slightly. The manager noted that\nmarkets continued to be attentive to news related to trade policy, though markets’ reaction to\nincoming information on this topic was more restrained than in April and May. Against this backdrop,\nthe manager reported that the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey)\nindicated that the median respondent’s expectations regarding both real gross domestic product\n(GDP) growth and inflation were roughly unchanged.\nThe manager turned next to policy rate expectations, which held steady over the intermeeting period,\nconsistent with a relatively stable macroeconomic outlook. The median modal path of the federal\nfunds rate, as given in the Desk survey, was unchanged from the corresponding path in the June\n1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes.\n2 \" \"\nsurvey and continued to indicate expectations of two 25 basis point rate cuts in the second half of this\nyear. Market-based measures of policy rate expectations were also little changed and indicated\nexpectations of one to two 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the year.\nThe manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the\nintermeeting period, consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook\nand in policy rate expectations. Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed\nto an increase in near-term market measures of inflation compensation, while longer-horizon\nmeasures of inflation compensation rose more modestly.\nThe manager then turned to market pricing of risky assets. The increases in equity prices and\nnarrowing of credit spreads suggested that markets assessed that the overall U.S. economy was\nremaining resilient; still, financial markets appeared to be making distinctions between individual\ncorporations on the basis of the size and quality of their earnings. Valuations of the S&P 500 index\ncontinued to move above long-run average levels, mostly driven by optimism about the largest\ntechnology firms’ scope to benefit from the further adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). However,\nvaluations of an index of smaller-capitalization firms, although higher over the intermeeting period,\nremained below their historical averages.\nRegarding foreign exchange developments, the manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar\nindex had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in\nrecent intermeeting periods. At the same time, the manager noted that correlations between the\ndollar and its fundamental drivers had normalized recently. The available data continued to suggest\nrelative stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets.\nThe manager turned next to money markets. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the\nintermeeting period. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher than\nthe low levels seen in the previous intermeeting period. The manager observed that two factors\ncontributed to this slight increase: the normal upward pressure on money market rates associated\nwith the June quarter-end; and the rise in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the\nTreasury General Account (TGA) balance following the increase in the debt limit in early July. On\nJune 30, as market rates climbed modestly above the standing repo facility’s (SRF) minimum bid rate\nat quarter-end, there was material usage of the facility, with counterparties borrowing a bit more than\n$11 billion, the highest utilization to date.\nThe manager also discussed the projected trajectory of various Federal Reserve liabilities. With\nincreased Treasury bill issuance associated with the rebuilding of the TGA balance likely to result in a\nrise in money market rates, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility\n\" \" 3\nwas expected to decline to low levels relatively soon. Market indicators continued to suggest that\nreserves remained abundant; however, ongoing System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio runoff,\na substantial expected increase in the TGA balance, and the depletion of the ON RRP facility were\ntogether likely to bring about a sustained decline in reserves for the first time since portfolio runoff\nstarted in June 2022. Against this backdrop, the staff would continue to monitor indicators of reserve\nconditions closely. The manager also noted that there would be times—such as quarter-ends, tax\ndates, and days associated with large settlements of Treasury securities—when reserves were likely to\ndip temporarily to even lower levels. At those times, utilization of the SRF would likely support the\nsmooth functioning of money markets and the implementation of monetary policy.\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting\nperiod. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during\nthe intermeeting period."

         "Staff Review of the Economic Situation\nThe information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP expanded at a tepid pace\nin the first half of the year. The unemployment rate continued to be low, and consumer price inflation\nremained somewhat elevated.\nDisinflation appeared to have stalled, with tariffs putting upward pressure on goods price inflation.\nTotal consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE)—was estimated to have been 2.5 percent in June, based on the\nconsumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer\nenergy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.7 percent in June. Both\ninflation rates were similar to their year-earlier levels.\nRecent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid. The unemployment rate was\n4.1 percent in June, down 0.1 percentage point from May. The participation rate edged down\n0.1 percentage point in June, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. Total nonfarm\npayroll gains were solid in June, though the pace of private payroll gains stepped down noticeably.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in June and remained within the narrow\nrange seen over the past year. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the\n12 months ending in June, slightly lower than the year-earlier pace.\nAccording to the advance estimate, real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first\nquarter. Growth of real private domestic final purchases—which comprises PCE and private fixed\ninvestment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—\nslowed in the second quarter, as a step-down in investment growth offset faster PCE growth.\n4 \" \"\nAfter exerting a substantial negative drag on GDP growth in the first quarter, net exports made a large\npositive contribution in the second quarter. Real imports of goods and services declined sharply, likely\nreflecting the aftereffects of the substantial front-loading of imports recorded in the first quarter ahead\nof anticipated tariff hikes. By contrast, exports of goods declined at a more moderate pace, and\nexports of services rose further.\nAbroad, activity indicators pointed to a slowdown of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, as\nthe transitory boost due to the front-loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded. Of note, monthly\nGDP data through May indicated that economic activity contracted in Canada. China’s GDP, however,\ncontinued to expand at a moderate pace in the second quarter, supported by solid domestic spending.\nHeadline inflation rates were near targets in most foreign economies, held down by past declines in oil\nprices and fading wage pressures following a tightening in monetary policy stances over the past few\nyears. However, core inflation remained somewhat elevated in some foreign economies.\nOver the intermeeting period, several foreign central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico and the Swiss\nNational Bank, further eased their monetary policy stance, while others, such as the Bank of England\nand the European Central Bank, held their policy rates steady. In their communications, foreign\ncentral banks continued to emphasize that U.S. trade policies and accompanying uncertainty have\nstarted to weigh on economic activity in their economies."

         "Staff Review of the Financial Situation\nOver the intermeeting period, both the market-implied expected path of the federal funds rate over the\nnext year and nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, while real yields declined. Inflation\ncompensation rose across the maturity spectrum—particularly at shorter horizons—reflecting, at least\nin part, perceived risks associated with trade policy developments.\nBroad equity price indexes increased and credit spreads tightened, consistent with improving risk\nsentiment attributed in part to easing geopolitical tensions as well as stronger-than-expected\neconomic activity. Credit spreads for all rating categories except the lowest-quality bonds narrowed to\nexceptionally low levels relative to their historical distribution. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of\nnear-term equity market volatility—declined moderately to just below the median of its historical\ndistribution.\nOver the intermeeting period, news about trade policy interpreted as positive by investors together\nwith some easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East led to moderate increases in foreign\nequity prices and longer-term yields. The broad dollar index was little changed on net.\n\" \" 5\nConditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period while\ndisplaying typical quarter-end dynamics. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became law on July 4,\nended the previous debt issuance suspension period, after which the TGA balance increased from\n$313 billion on July 3 to an expected $500 billion by the end of July. Rates in secured markets were,\non average, somewhat elevated relative to the average over the previous intermeeting period, owing in\npart to quarter-end effects. Although upward pressure on repo rates was modest at quarter-end, take-\nup at the SRF was $11.1 billion on June 30—its highest level since the inception of the facility—as the\naddition of an early settlement option seemed to encourage participation. Average usage of the ON\nRRP facility was little changed over the intermeeting period.\nIn domestic credit markets, borrowing costs facing businesses, households, and municipalities eased\nmoderately but remained elevated relative to post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) average levels. Yields\non both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly, while interest rates on small\nbusiness loans were little changed on net. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential\nmortgages were little changed and remained near the top of the post-GFC historical distribution.\nInterest rates on new auto loans and for new credit card offers have fluctuated in a narrow range in\nrecent months around the upper end of their post-GFC distributions.\nCredit remained generally available. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was\nreadily accessible for public corporations as well as large and middle-market private corporations.\nIssuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid in June, and private credit\ncontinued to be broadly available despite ebbing somewhat in May and June. Loan balances on\nbanks’ books increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter, led by growth in commercial and\nindustrial (C&I) loans. Lending to small businesses remained subdued, an outcome attributed to weak\nborrower demand.\nBanks in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that, on net,\nunderwriting standards were little changed in the second quarter across most loan categories,\nalthough the level of standards remained on the tighter end of their historical range. C&I loan\nstandards, however, were reported to be a little easier than the range seen since 2005, yet still\nsomewhat tighter than in periods not associated with financial stress. Consumer credit continued to\nbe readily available for high-credit-score borrowers, though growth in applications for home purchases,\nrefinances, auto loans, and revolving credit was relatively weak, reflecting heightened borrowing costs\nand tighter credit standards for lower-credit-score borrowers.\nIn the second quarter, credit performance was generally stable but somewhat weaker than pre-\npandemic levels. Corporate bond and leveraged loan credit performance declined moderately in May\nand June, though defaults remained below post-GFC medians through June. In the commercial real\n6 \" \"\nestate market, delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities remained elevated\nthrough June. The rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages\ncontinued to be elevated. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types\ncontinued to stay near historical lows. In May, the credit card delinquency rate was a little below its\nyear-earlier value, while that for auto loans was roughly the same as in May last year; both were\nelevated relative to their pre-pandemic levels. Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus\nshot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on-ramp period for student loan\npayments.\nThe staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance,\ncontinued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset\nvaluation pressures were elevated. In equity markets, price-to-earnings ratios stood at the upper end\nof their historical distribution, while spreads on high-yield corporate bonds narrowed notably and were\nlow relative to their historical distribution. Housing valuations edged down but remained elevated.\nVulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial business and household debt were characterized as\nmoderate. Household debt to GDP was at its lowest level in the past 20 years, and household balance\nsheets remained strong. The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained solid. For\nprivate firms, debt grew at a rapid pace, while these firms’ interest coverage ratios declined to the\nlower range of their historical distributions, suggesting that vulnerabilities may be growing in that\nsector.\nVulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable.\nRegulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high, while recent annual supervisory stress-\ntest results showed that all participants stayed above minimum capital requirements even under\nstress conditions. Banks, however, were still seen as more exposed to interest rate risk than had\nbeen historically typical, albeit to a lesser degree than was the case earlier in the decade. In the\nnonbank sector, life insurers’ allocation of assets toward private credit and risky assets, funded in part\nby nontraditional liabilities with short maturities, continued to grow. Leverage and rollover risk at\nhedge funds remained high and concentrated in the largest firms.\nVulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Money market funds\n(MMFs) continued to be vulnerable to runs, though the aggregate assets of such prime and prime-like\ninvestment vehicles remained in the middle of their historical range as a fraction of GDP. Prime-like\nalternatives—including private liquidity funds, offshore MMFs, and stablecoins—have grown rapidly and\nwere noted as relatively less transparent."

         "Staff Economic Outlook\nThe staff’s real GDP growth projection for this year through 2027 was similar to the one prepared for\nthe June meeting, reflecting the offsetting effects of several revisions to the outlook. The staff\nexpected that the rise in the cost of imported goods inclusive of tariffs would be smaller and occur\nlater than in their previous forecast; in addition, financial conditions were projected to be slightly more\nsupportive of output growth. However, these positive influences on the outlook were offset by weaker-\nthan-expected spending data and a smaller assumed population boost from net immigration. The\nstaff continued to expect that the labor market would weaken, with the unemployment rate projected\nto move above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate around the end of this year and to remain above\nthe natural rate through 2027.\nThe staff’s inflation projection was slightly lower than the one prepared for the June meeting, reflecting\nthe downward revision to the assumed effects of tariffs on imported goods prices. Tariffs were\nexpected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in 2026;\ninflation was then projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\nThe staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting\nuncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including trade policy, and their associated\neconomic effects. Risks to real activity were judged to remain skewed to the downside in light of the\nweakening in GDP growth seen so far this year and elevated policy uncertainty. The staff continued to\nview the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation\nthis year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection."

         "Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nIn their discussion of inflation, many participants observed that overall inflation remained somewhat\nabove the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that tariff effects were becoming\nmore apparent in the data, as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation, while services\nprice inflation had continued to slow. A couple of participants suggested that tariff effects were\nmasking the underlying trend of inflation and, setting aside the tariff effects, inflation was close to\ntarget.\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected inflation to increase in the near\nterm. Participants judged that considerable uncertainty remained about the timing, magnitude, and\npersistence of the effects of this year’s increase in tariffs. In terms of timing, many participants noted\nthat it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and\nservices prices. Participants cited several contributors to this likely lag. These included the\nstockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs; slow pass-through of input cost increases into\n8 \" \"\nfinal goods and services prices; gradual updating of contract prices; maintenance of firm–customer\nrelationships; issues related to tariff collection; and still-ongoing trade negotiations. As for the\nmagnitude of tariff effects on prices, a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that\nforeign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs, implying that domestic\nbusinesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs. Several participants, drawing\non information provided by business contacts or business surveys, expected that many companies\nwould increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end-customers over time. However, a few\nparticipants reported that business contacts and survey respondents described a mix of strategies as\nbeing undertaken to avoid fully passing on tariff costs to customers. Such strategies included\nnegotiating with or switching suppliers, changing production processes, lowering profit margins,\nexerting more wage discipline, or exploiting cost-saving efficiency measures such as automation and\nnew technologies. A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms’\nability to pass tariff costs into prices. Regarding inflation persistence, a few participants emphasized\nthat they expected higher tariffs to lead only to a one-time increase in the price level that would be\nrealized over a reasonably contained period. A few participants remarked that tariff-related factors,\nincluding supply chain disruptions, could lead to stubbornly elevated inflation and that it may be\ndifficult to disentangle tariff-related price increases from changes in underlying trend inflation.\nParticipants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it\nwas important that they remain so. Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded\n2 percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer-term inflation\nexpectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn-out effects of higher tariffs on inflation. A\ncouple of participants noted that inflation expectations would likely be influenced by the behavior of\nthe overall inflation rate, inclusive of the effects of tariffs. Various participants emphasized the central\nrole of monetary policy in ensuring that tariff effects did not lead to persistently higher expected and\nrealized inflation.\nIn their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that the unemployment rate remained\nlow and that employment was at or near estimates of maximum employment. Several participants\nnoted that the low and stable unemployment rate reflected a combination of low hiring and low\nlayoffs. Some participants observed that their contacts and business survey respondents had\nreported being reluctant to hire or fire amid elevated uncertainty. Regarding the outlook for the labor\nmarket, some participants mentioned indicators that could suggest a softening in labor demand.\nThese included slower and more concentrated job growth, an increase in cyclically sensitive Black and\nyouth unemployment rates, and lower wage increases of job switchers than job stayers. Some of\nthese participants also noted anecdotes in the Beige Book or in their discussions with contacts that\npointed to slower demand. Furthermore, a number of participants noted that softness in aggregate\n\" \" 9\ndemand and economic activity may translate into weaker labor market conditions, as could a potential\ninability of some importers to withstand higher tariffs. Some participants remarked, however, that\nslower output or employment growth was not necessarily indicative of emerging economic slack\nbecause a decline in immigration was lowering both actual and potential output growth as well as\nreducing both actual payroll growth and the number of new jobs needed to keep the unemployment\nrate stable. A few participants relayed reports received from contacts that immigration policies were\naffecting labor supply in some sectors, including construction and agriculture.\nParticipants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year, driven in\nlarge part by slower consumption growth and a decline in residential investment. Several participants\nstated that they expected growth in economic activity to remain low in the second half of this year.\nSome participants noted that economic activity would nevertheless be supported by financial\nconditions, including elevated household net worth, and a couple of participants highlighted stable or\nlow credit card delinquencies. A couple of participants remarked that economic activity would be\nsupported by the resolution of policy uncertainty over time. Regarding the household sector, several\nparticipants observed that slower real income growth may be weighing on growth in consumer\nspending. A few participants noted a weakening in housing demand, with increased availability of\nhomes for sale and falling house prices. As for businesses, several participants remarked that\nongoing policy uncertainty had continued to slow business investment, but several observed that\nbusiness sentiment had improved in recent months. A few participants commented that the\nagricultural sector faced headwinds due to low crop prices.\nIn their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, participants\njudged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated, though several participants\nremarked that there had been some reduction in uncertainty regarding fiscal policy, immigration\npolicy, or tariff policy. Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual\nmandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment. A majority of\nparticipants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks, while several\nparticipants viewed the two risks as roughly balanced, and a couple of participants considered\ndownside risk to employment the more salient risk. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants\npointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming\nunanchored. In addition to tariff-induced risks, potential downside risks to employment mentioned by\nparticipants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums, a\nmore substantial deterioration in the housing market, and the risk that the increased use of AI in the\nworkplace may lower employment.\nIn their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the\nfinancial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Several participants noted concerns about\n10 \" \"\nelevated asset valuation pressures. Regarding banks, a couple of participants commented that,\nthough regulatory capital levels remained strong, some banks continued to be vulnerable to a rise in\nlonger-term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets. A few participants\ncommented on vulnerabilities in the market for Treasury securities, raising concerns about dealer\nintermediation capacity, the increasing presence of hedge funds in the market, and the fragility\nassociated with low market depth. A couple of participants discussed foreign exchange swaps, noting\nthat these served as key sources of dollar funding for foreign financial institutions that lend dollars to\ntheir customers in the U.S. and abroad, but also that they entailed vulnerabilities due to maturity\nmismatch and rollover risk. Many participants discussed recent and prospective developments\nrelated to payment stablecoins and possible implications for the financial system. These participants\nnoted that use of payment stablecoins might grow following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act\n(Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act). They remarked that payment\nstablecoins could help improve the efficiency of the payment system. They also observed that such\nstablecoins could increase the demand for the assets needed to back them, including Treasury\nsecurities. In addition, participants who commented raised concerns that stablecoins could have\nbroader implications for the banking and financial systems as well as monetary policy implementation,\nand thus warranted close attention, including monitoring of the various assets used to back\nstablecoins.\nIn their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained\nsomewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that the growth of\neconomic activity had moderated in the first half of the year, although swings in net exports and\ninventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted\nthat the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that the labor market was at or near\nmaximum employment. Participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained\nelevated. Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent at this meeting. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the\nprocess of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nIn considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that, with the labor\nmarket still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was\nwell positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. Participants agreed\nthat monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and\nthe balance of risks. Participants assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more\napparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation\nremained to be seen. They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude\nand persistence of higher tariffs’ effects on inflation. Even so, some participants emphasized that a\n\" \" 11\ngreat deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data, helping to inform their assessment\nof the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate; at the same time, some\nnoted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs’ effects on\ninflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Some participants stressed that the issue of\nthe persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary\npolicy. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may\nnot be far above its neutral level; among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was\nthe likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic\nactivity.\nIn discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy,\nparticipants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment\nremained elevated. Participants noted that, if this year’s higher tariffs were to generate a larger-than-\nexpected or a more-persistent-than-anticipated increase in inflation, or if medium- or longer-term\ninflation expectations were to increase notably, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more\nrestrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market\nconditions remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if\ninflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would\nbe appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the\ncase. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved\nto be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened. Participants agreed that, if\nthat situation were to occur, they would consider each variable’s distance from the Committee’s goal\nand the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to\nclose. Participants noted that, in this context, it was especially important to ensure that longer-term\ninflation expectations remained well anchored.\nSeveral participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Of those who\ncommented, participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus\nfar and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant. They agreed that, with reserves\nprojected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit\nsituation, it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate\nhow close reserves were to their ample level. A few participants also assessed that, in this\nenvironment, abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days.\nThey noted that, if such events created pressures in money markets, the Federal Reserve’s existing\ntools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target\nrange. A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementation—as\n12 \" \"\nreflected in increased usage at the June quarter-end—and expressed support for further study of the\npossibility of central clearing of the SRF to enhance its effectiveness."

         "Committee Policy Actions\nIn their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net\nexports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had\nmoderated in the first half of the year. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at\na low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation\nremained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook\nremained elevated and that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual\nmandate.\nIn support of the Committee’s goals, almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for\nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. These members judged that, excluding tariff\neffects, inflation was running close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that higher tariffs were\nunlikely to have persistent effects on inflation. Furthermore, they assessed that downside risk to\nemployment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and\nconsumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions,\nincluding low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of\nindustries that were less affected by the business cycle. Members agreed that in considering the\nextent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the\nCommittee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All\nmembers agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to\nsupporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.\nMembers agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be\nprepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede\nthe attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take\ninto account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation\npressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\n\" \" 13\n“Effective July 31, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:\n• Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target\nrange of 4¼ to 4½ percent.\n• Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of\n4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.\n• Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of\n4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.\n• Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of\nTreasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per\nmonth. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the\nextent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.\n• Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that\nexceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity\ncomposition of Treasury securities outstanding.\n• Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational\nreasons.”\nThe vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\n“Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that\ngrowth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate\nremains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent\nover the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The\nCommittee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue\nreducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and\nreturning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\n14 \" \"\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee\nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that\ncould impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will\ntake into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions,\ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”\nVoting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D.\nCook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, and Jeffrey R. Schmid.\nVoting against this action: Michelle W. Bowman and Christopher J. Waller.\nAbsent and not voting: Adriana D. Kugler\nGovernors Bowman and Waller preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point at this meeting. Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target\nrange for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4¼ percent in light of inflation moving\nconsiderably closer to the Committee’s objective, after excluding temporary effects of tariffs, a labor\nmarket near full employment but with signs of less dynamism, and slowing economic growth this year.\nShe also expressed her view that taking action to begin moving the policy rate at a gradual pace\ntoward its neutral level would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy\nand the risk of damage to the labor market.\nConsistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate\nunchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the\ninterest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective July 31, 2025. The Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit\nrate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday,\nSeptember 16–17, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on July 30, 2025."

         "Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments  Over the intermeeting period  the expected path of the policy rate and longer term Treasury yields were little changed  equity prices increased  credit spreads narrowed  and the dollar depreciated slightly  The manager noted that markets continued to be attentive to news related to trade policy  though markets  reaction to incoming information on this topic was more restrained than in April and May  Against this backdrop  the manager reported that the Open Market Desk s Survey of Market Expectations  Desk survey  indicated that the median respondent s expectations regarding both real gross domestic product  GDP  growth and inflation were roughly unchanged  The manager turned next to policy rate expectations  which held steady over the intermeeting period  consistent with a relatively stable macroeconomic outlook  The median modal path of the federal funds rate  as given in the Desk survey  was unchanged from the corresponding path in the June   The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the  FOMC  and the  Committee  in these minutes  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the  Board  in these minutes        survey and continued to indicate expectations of two    basis point rate cuts in the second half of this year  Market based measures of policy rate expectations were also little changed and indicated expectations of one to two    basis point rate cuts by the end of the year  The manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market based measures of inflation compensation  Nominal Treasury yields were little changed  on net  over the intermeeting period  consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook and in policy rate expectations  Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed to an increase in near term market measures of inflation compensation  while longer horizon measures of inflation compensation rose more modestly  The manager then turned to market pricing of risky assets  The increases in equity prices and narrowing of credit spreads suggested that markets assessed that the overall U S  economy was remaining resilient  still  financial markets appeared to be making distinctions between individual corporations on the basis of the size and quality of their earnings  Valuations of the S&P     index continued to move above long run average levels  mostly driven by optimism about the largest technology firms  scope to benefit from the further adoption of artificial intelligence  AI   However  valuations of an index of smaller capitalization firms  although higher over the intermeeting period  remained below their historical averages  Regarding foreign exchange developments  the manager noted that the broad trade weighted dollar index had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in recent intermeeting periods  At the same time  the manager noted that correlations between the dollar and its fundamental drivers had normalized recently  The available data continued to suggest relative stability in foreign holdings of U S  assets  The manager turned next to money markets  Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period  Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements  repo  were somewhat higher than the low levels seen in the previous intermeeting period  The manager observed that two factors contributed to this slight increase  the normal upward pressure on money market rates associated with the June quarter end  and the rise in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account  TGA  balance following the increase in the debt limit in early July  On June     as market rates climbed modestly above the standing repo facility s  SRF  minimum bid rate at quarter end  there was material usage of the facility  with counterparties borrowing a bit more than $   billion  the highest utilization to date  The manager also discussed the projected trajectory of various Federal Reserve liabilities  With increased Treasury bill issuance associated with the rebuilding of the TGA balance likely to result in a rise in money market rates  take up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement  ON RRP  facility       was expected to decline to low levels relatively soon  Market indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant  however  ongoing System Open Market Account  SOMA  portfolio runoff  a substantial expected increase in the TGA balance  and the depletion of the ON RRP facility were together likely to bring about a sustained decline in reserves for the first time since portfolio runoff started in June       Against this backdrop  the staff would continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions closely  The manager also noted that there would be times such as quarter ends  tax dates  and days associated with large settlements of Treasury securities when reserves were likely to dip temporarily to even lower levels  At those times  utilization of the SRF would likely support the smooth functioning of money markets and the implementation of monetary policy  By unanimous vote  the Committee ratified the Desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period

         "Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP expanded at a tepid pace in the first half of the year  The unemployment rate continued to be low  and consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated  Disinflation appeared to have stalled  with tariffs putting upward pressure on goods price inflation  Total consumer price inflation as measured by the    month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures  PCE  was estimated to have been     percent in June  based on the consumer and producer price indexes  Core PCE price inflation  which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices  was estimated to have been     percent in June  Both inflation rates were similar to their year earlier levels  Recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid  The unemployment rate was     percent in June  down     percentage point from May  The participation rate edged down     percentage point in June  and the employment to population ratio was unchanged  Total nonfarm payroll gains were solid in June  though the pace of private payroll gains stepped down noticeably  The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was     in June and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose     percent over the    months ending in June  slightly lower than the year earlier pace  According to the advance estimate  real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter  Growth of real private domestic final purchases which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum  slowed in the second quarter  as a step down in investment growth offset faster PCE growth        After exerting a substantial negative drag on GDP growth in the first quarter  net exports made a large positive contribution in the second quarter  Real imports of goods and services declined sharply  likely reflecting the aftereffects of the substantial front loading of imports recorded in the first quarter ahead of anticipated tariff hikes  By contrast  exports of goods declined at a more moderate pace  and exports of services rose further  Abroad  activity indicators pointed to a slowdown of foreign economic growth in the second quarter  as the transitory boost due to the front loading of U S  imports earlier in the year faded  Of note  monthly GDP data through May indicated that economic activity contracted in Canada  China s GDP  however  continued to expand at a moderate pace in the second quarter  supported by solid domestic spending  Headline inflation rates were near targets in most foreign economies  held down by past declines in oil prices and fading wage pressures following a tightening in monetary policy stances over the past few years  However  core inflation remained somewhat elevated in some foreign economies  Over the intermeeting period  several foreign central banks  such as the Bank of Mexico and the Swiss National Bank  further eased their monetary policy stance  while others  such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank  held their policy rates steady  In their communications  foreign central banks continued to emphasize that U S  trade policies and accompanying uncertainty have started to weigh on economic activity in their economies ",

         "Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period  both the market implied expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year and nominal Treasury yields were little changed  on net  while real yields declined  Inflation compensation rose across the maturity spectrum particularly at shorter horizons reflecting  at least in part  perceived risks associated with trade policy developments  Broad equity price indexes increased and credit spreads tightened  consistent with improving risk sentiment attributed in part to easing geopolitical tensions as well as stronger than expected economic activity  Credit spreads for all rating categories except the lowest quality bonds narrowed to exceptionally low levels relative to their historical distribution  The VIX a forward looking measure of near term equity market volatility declined moderately to just below the median of its historical distribution  Over the intermeeting period  news about trade policy interpreted as positive by investors together with some easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East led to moderate increases in foreign equity prices and longer term yields  The broad dollar index was little changed on net        Conditions in U S  short term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period while displaying typical quarter end dynamics  The One Big Beautiful Bill Act  which became law on July    ended the previous debt issuance suspension period  after which the TGA balance increased from $    billion on July   to an expected $    billion by the end of July  Rates in secured markets were  on average  somewhat elevated relative to the average over the previous intermeeting period  owing in part to quarter end effects  Although upward pressure on repo rates was modest at quarter end  take  up at the SRF was $     billion on June    its highest level since the inception of the facility as the addition of an early settlement option seemed to encourage participation  Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed over the intermeeting period  In domestic credit markets  borrowing costs facing businesses  households  and municipalities eased moderately but remained elevated relative to post Global Financial Crisis  GFC  average levels  Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly  while interest rates on small business loans were little changed on net  Rates on    year fixed rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained near the top of the post GFC historical distribution  Interest rates on new auto loans and for new credit card offers have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent months around the upper end of their post GFC distributions  Credit remained generally available  Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations as well as large and middle market private corporations  Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid in June  and private credit continued to be broadly available despite ebbing somewhat in May and June  Loan balances on banks  books increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter  led by growth in commercial and industrial  C&I  loans  Lending to small businesses remained subdued  an outcome attributed to weak borrower demand  Banks in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that  on net  underwriting standards were little changed in the second quarter across most loan categories  although the level of standards remained on the tighter end of their historical range  C&I loan standards  however  were reported to be a little easier than the range seen since       yet still somewhat tighter than in periods not associated with financial stress  Consumer credit continued to be readily available for high credit score borrowers  though growth in applications for home purchases  refinances  auto loans  and revolving credit was relatively weak  reflecting heightened borrowing costs and tighter credit standards for lower credit score borrowers  In the second quarter  credit performance was generally stable but somewhat weaker than pre  pandemic levels  Corporate bond and leveraged loan credit performance declined moderately in May and June  though defaults remained below post GFC medians through June  In the commercial real       estate market  delinquency rates on commercial mortgage backed securities remained elevated through June  The rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to be elevated  By contrast  delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows  In May  the credit card delinquency rate was a little below its year earlier value  while that for auto loans was roughly the same as in May last year  both were elevated relative to their pre pandemic levels  Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on ramp period for student loan payments  The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U S  financial system and  on balance  continued to characterize the system s financial vulnerabilities as notable  The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated  In equity markets  price to earnings ratios stood at the upper end of their historical distribution  while spreads on high yield corporate bonds narrowed notably and were low relative to their historical distribution  Housing valuations edged down but remained elevated  Vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial business and household debt were characterized as moderate  Household debt to GDP was at its lowest level in the past    years  and household balance sheets remained strong  The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained solid  For private firms  debt grew at a rapid pace  while these firms  interest coverage ratios declined to the lower range of their historical distributions  suggesting that vulnerabilities may be growing in that sector  Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable  Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high  while recent annual supervisory stress  test results showed that all participants stayed above minimum capital requirements even under stress conditions  Banks  however  were still seen as more exposed to interest rate risk than had been historically typical  albeit to a lesser degree than was the case earlier in the decade  In the nonbank sector  life insurers  allocation of assets toward private credit and risky assets  funded in part by nontraditional liabilities with short maturities  continued to grow  Leverage and rollover risk at hedge funds remained high and concentrated in the largest firms  Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate  Money market funds  MMFs  continued to be vulnerable to runs  though the aggregate assets of such prime and prime like investment vehicles remained in the middle of their historical range as a fraction of GDP  Prime like alternatives including private liquidity funds  offshore MMFs  and stablecoins have grown rapidly and were noted as relatively less transparent ",

         "Staff Economic Outlook The staff s real GDP growth projection for this year through      was similar to the one prepared for the June meeting  reflecting the offsetting effects of several revisions to the outlook  The staff expected that the rise in the cost of imported goods inclusive of tariffs would be smaller and occur later than in their previous forecast  in addition  financial conditions were projected to be slightly more supportive of output growth  However  these positive influences on the outlook were offset by weaker  than expected spending data and a smaller assumed population boost from net immigration  The staff continued to expect that the labor market would weaken  with the unemployment rate projected to move above the staff s estimate of its natural rate around the end of this year and to remain above the natural rate through       The staff s inflation projection was slightly lower than the one prepared for the June meeting  reflecting the downward revision to the assumed effects of tariffs on imported goods prices  Tariffs were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in       inflation was then projected to decline to   percent by       The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated  primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies  including trade policy  and their associated economic effects  Risks to real activity were judged to remain skewed to the downside in light of the weakening in GDP growth seen so far this year and elevated policy uncertainty  The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside  as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection ",

         "Participants  Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of inflation  many participants observed that overall inflation remained somewhat above the Committee s   percent longer run goal  Participants noted that tariff effects were becoming more apparent in the data  as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation  while services price inflation had continued to slow  A couple of participants suggested that tariff effects were masking the underlying trend of inflation and  setting aside the tariff effects  inflation was close to target  With regard to the outlook for inflation  participants generally expected inflation to increase in the near term  Participants judged that considerable uncertainty remained about the timing  magnitude  and persistence of the effects of this year s increase in tariffs  In terms of timing  many participants noted that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and services prices  Participants cited several contributors to this likely lag  These included the stockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs  slow pass through of input cost increases into       final goods and services prices  gradual updating of contract prices  maintenance of firm customer relationships  issues related to tariff collection  and still ongoing trade negotiations  As for the magnitude of tariff effects on prices  a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs  implying that domestic businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs  Several participants  drawing on information provided by business contacts or business surveys  expected that many companies would increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end customers over time  However  a few participants reported that business contacts and survey respondents described a mix of strategies as being undertaken to avoid fully passing on tariff costs to customers  Such strategies included negotiating with or switching suppliers  changing production processes  lowering profit margins  exerting more wage discipline  or exploiting cost saving efficiency measures such as automation and new technologies  A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms  ability to pass tariff costs into prices  Regarding inflation persistence  a few participants emphasized that they expected higher tariffs to lead only to a one time increase in the price level that would be realized over a reasonably contained period  A few participants remarked that tariff related factors  including supply chain disruptions  could lead to stubbornly elevated inflation and that it may be difficult to disentangle tariff related price increases from changes in underlying trend inflation  Participants noted that longer term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important that they remain so  Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded   percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer term inflation expectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn out effects of higher tariffs on inflation  A couple of participants noted that inflation expectations would likely be influenced by the behavior of the overall inflation rate  inclusive of the effects of tariffs  Various participants emphasized the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that tariff effects did not lead to persistently higher expected and realized inflation  In their discussion of the labor market  participants observed that the unemployment rate remained low and that employment was at or near estimates of maximum employment  Several participants noted that the low and stable unemployment rate reflected a combination of low hiring and low layoffs  Some participants observed that their contacts and business survey respondents had reported being reluctant to hire or fire amid elevated uncertainty  Regarding the outlook for the labor market  some participants mentioned indicators that could suggest a softening in labor demand  These included slower and more concentrated job growth  an increase in cyclically sensitive Black and youth unemployment rates  and lower wage increases of job switchers than job stayers  Some of these participants also noted anecdotes in the Beige Book or in their discussions with contacts that pointed to slower demand  Furthermore  a number of participants noted that softness in aggregate       demand and economic activity may translate into weaker labor market conditions  as could a potential inability of some importers to withstand higher tariffs  Some participants remarked  however  that slower output or employment growth was not necessarily indicative of emerging economic slack because a decline in immigration was lowering both actual and potential output growth as well as reducing both actual payroll growth and the number of new jobs needed to keep the unemployment rate stable  A few participants relayed reports received from contacts that immigration policies were affecting labor supply in some sectors  including construction and agriculture  Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year  driven in large part by slower consumption growth and a decline in residential investment  Several participants stated that they expected growth in economic activity to remain low in the second half of this year  Some participants noted that economic activity would nevertheless be supported by financial conditions  including elevated household net worth  and a couple of participants highlighted stable or low credit card delinquencies  A couple of participants remarked that economic activity would be supported by the resolution of policy uncertainty over time  Regarding the household sector  several participants observed that slower real income growth may be weighing on growth in consumer spending  A few participants noted a weakening in housing demand  with increased availability of homes for sale and falling house prices  As for businesses  several participants remarked that ongoing policy uncertainty had continued to slow business investment  but several observed that business sentiment had improved in recent months  A few participants commented that the agricultural sector faced headwinds due to low crop prices  In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook  participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated  though several participants remarked that there had been some reduction in uncertainty regarding fiscal policy  immigration policy  or tariff policy  Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee s dual mandate  emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment  A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks  while several participants viewed the two risks as roughly balanced  and a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient risk  Regarding upside risks to inflation  participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored  In addition to tariff induced risks  potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums  a more substantial deterioration in the housing market  and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment  In their discussion of financial stability  participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring  Several participants noted concerns about        elevated asset valuation pressures  Regarding banks  a couple of participants commented that  though regulatory capital levels remained strong  some banks continued to be vulnerable to a rise in longer term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets  A few participants commented on vulnerabilities in the market for Treasury securities  raising concerns about dealer intermediation capacity  the increasing presence of hedge funds in the market  and the fragility associated with low market depth  A couple of participants discussed foreign exchange swaps  noting that these served as key sources of dollar funding for foreign financial institutions that lend dollars to their customers in the U S  and abroad  but also that they entailed vulnerabilities due to maturity mismatch and rollover risk  Many participants discussed recent and prospective developments related to payment stablecoins and possible implications for the financial system  These participants noted that use of payment stablecoins might grow following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act  Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U S  Stablecoins Act   They remarked that payment stablecoins could help improve the efficiency of the payment system  They also observed that such stablecoins could increase the demand for the assets needed to back them  including Treasury securities  In addition  participants who commented raised concerns that stablecoins could have broader implications for the banking and financial systems as well as monetary policy implementation  and thus warranted close attention  including monitoring of the various assets used to back stablecoins  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting  participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated  Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year  although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data  Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that the labor market was at or near maximum employment  Participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated  Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent at this meeting  All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings  In considering the outlook for monetary policy  almost all participants agreed that  with the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive  the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments  Participants agreed that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data  the economic outlook  and the balance of risks  Participants assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remained to be seen  They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs  effects on inflation  Even so  some participants emphasized that a        great deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data  helping to inform their assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate  at the same time  some noted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs  effects on inflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy  Some participants stressed that the issue of the persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary policy  Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level  among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was the likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic activity  In discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy  participants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment remained elevated  Participants noted that  if this year s higher tariffs were to generate a larger than  expected or a more persistent than anticipated increase in inflation  or if medium  or longer term inflation expectations were to increase notably  then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case  especially if labor market conditions remained solid  By contrast  if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if inflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored  then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case  Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened  Participants agreed that  if that situation were to occur  they would consider each variable s distance from the Committee s goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close  Participants noted that  in this context  it was especially important to ensure that longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored  Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve s balance sheet  Of those who commented  participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant  They agreed that  with reserves projected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit situation  it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level  A few participants also assessed that  in this environment  abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days  They noted that  if such events created pressures in money markets  the Federal Reserve s existing tools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range  A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementation as        reflected in increased usage at the June quarter end and expressed support for further study of the possibility of central clearing of the SRF to enhance its effectiveness ",

         "Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting  members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data  recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year  Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid  Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated  Members agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate  In support of the Committee s goals  almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent  A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by    basis points at this meeting  These members judged that  excluding tariff effects  inflation was running close to the Committee s   percent objective and that higher tariffs were unlikely to have persistent effects on inflation  Furthermore  they assessed that downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending  and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions  including low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of industries that were less affected by the business cycle  Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  the Committee would carefully assess incoming data  the evolving outlook  and the balance of risks  All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee s   percent objective  Members agreed that  in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook  They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals  Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information  including readings on labor market conditions  inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and financial and international developments  At the conclusion of the discussion  the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  until instructed otherwise  to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive  for release at      p m           Effective July           the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to    Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of    to    percent    Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of     percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $    billion    Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of      percent and with a per counterparty limit of $    billion per day    Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $  billion per month  Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap    Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities  MBS  received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $   billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding    Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments  if needed for operational reasons   The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at      p m    Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data  recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year  The unemployment rate remains low  and labor market conditions remain solid  Inflation remains somewhat elevated  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of   percent over the longer run  Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated  The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate  In support of its goals  the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent  In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  the Committee will carefully assess incoming data  the evolving outlook  and the balance of risks  The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities  The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its   percent objective         In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook  The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals  The Committee s assessments will take into account a wide range of information  including readings on labor market conditions  inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and financial and international developments   Voting for this action  Jerome H  Powell  John C  Williams  Michael S  Barr  Susan M  Collins  Lisa D  Cook  Austan D  Goolsbee  Philip N  Jefferson  Alberto G  Musalem  and Jeffrey R  Schmid  Voting against this action  Michelle W  Bowman and Christopher J  Waller  Absent and not voting  Adriana D  Kugler Governors Bowman and Waller preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by   percentage point at this meeting  Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by    basis points to   to    percent in light of inflation moving considerably closer to the Committee s objective  after excluding temporary effects of tariffs  a labor market near full employment but with signs of less dynamism  and slowing economic growth this year  She also expressed her view that taking action to begin moving the policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market  Consistent with the Committee s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at     percent  effective July           The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of     percent  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday Wednesday  September              The meeting adjourned at       a m  on July          ",

         "Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments  Over the intermeeting period  the expected path of the policy rate and longer term Treasury yields were little changed  equity prices increased  credit spreads narrowed  and the dollar depreciated slightly  The manager noted that markets continued to be attentive to news related to trade policy  though markets  reaction to incoming information on this topic was more restrained than in April and May  Against this backdrop  the manager reported that the Open Market Desk s Survey of Market Expectations  Desk survey  indicated that the median respondent s expectations regarding both real gross domestic product  GDP  growth and inflation were roughly unchanged  The manager turned next to policy rate expectations  which held steady over the intermeeting period  consistent with a relatively stable macroeconomic outlook  The median modal path of the federal funds rate  as given in the Desk survey  was unchanged from the corresponding path in the June   The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the  FOMC  and the  Committee  in these minutes  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the  Board  in these minutes        survey and continued to indicate expectations of two    basis point rate cuts in the second half of this year  Market based measures of policy rate expectations were also little changed and indicated expectations of one to two    basis point rate cuts by the end of the year  The manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market based measures of inflation compensation  Nominal Treasury yields were little changed  on net  over the intermeeting period  consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook and in policy rate expectations  Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed to an increase in near term market measures of inflation compensation  while longer horizon measures of inflation compensation rose more modestly  The manager then turned to market pricing of risky assets  The increases in equity prices and narrowing of credit spreads suggested that markets assessed that the overall U S  economy was remaining resilient  still  financial markets appeared to be making distinctions between individual corporations on the basis of the size and quality of their earnings  Valuations of the S&P     index continued to move above long run average levels  mostly driven by optimism about the largest technology firms  scope to benefit from the further adoption of artificial intelligence  AI   However  valuations of an index of smaller capitalization firms  although higher over the intermeeting period  remained below their historical averages  Regarding foreign exchange developments  the manager noted that the broad trade weighted dollar index had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in recent intermeeting periods  At the same time  the manager noted that correlations between the dollar and its fundamental drivers had normalized recently  The available data continued to suggest relative stability in foreign holdings of U S  assets  The manager turned next to money markets  Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period  Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements  repo  were somewhat higher than the low levels seen in the previous intermeeting period  The manager observed that two factors contributed to this slight increase  the normal upward pressure on money market rates associated with the June quarter end  and the rise in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account  TGA  balance following the increase in the debt limit in early July  On June     as market rates climbed modestly above the standing repo facility s  SRF  minimum bid rate at quarter end  there was material usage of the facility  with counterparties borrowing a bit more than $   billion  the highest utilization to date  The manager also discussed the projected trajectory of various Federal Reserve liabilities  With increased Treasury bill issuance associated with the rebuilding of the TGA balance likely to result in a rise in money market rates  take up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement  ON RRP  facility       was expected to decline to low levels relatively soon  Market indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant  however  ongoing System Open Market Account  SOMA  portfolio runoff  a substantial expected increase in the TGA balance  and the depletion of the ON RRP facility were together likely to bring about a sustained decline in reserves for the first time since portfolio runoff started in June       Against this backdrop  the staff would continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions closely  The manager also noted that there would be times such as quarter ends  tax dates  and days associated with large settlements of Treasury securities when reserves were likely to dip temporarily to even lower levels  At those times  utilization of the SRF would likely support the smooth functioning of money markets and the implementation of monetary policy  By unanimous vote  the Committee ratified the Desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period

         "Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period  both the market implied expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year and nominal Treasury yields were little changed  on net  while real yields declined  Inflation compensation rose across the maturity spectrum particularly at shorter horizons reflecting  at least in part  perceived risks associated with trade policy developments  Broad equity price indexes increased and credit spreads tightened  consistent with improving risk sentiment attributed in part to easing geopolitical tensions as well as stronger than expected economic activity  Credit spreads for all rating categories except the lowest quality bonds narrowed to exceptionally low levels relative to their historical distribution  The VIX a forward looking measure of near term equity market volatility declined moderately to just below the median of its historical distribution  Over the intermeeting period  news about trade policy interpreted as positive by investors together with some easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East led to moderate increases in foreign equity prices and longer term yields  The broad dollar index was little changed on net        Conditions in U S  short term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period while displaying typical quarter end dynamics  The One Big Beautiful Bill Act  which became law on July    ended the previous debt issuance suspension period  after which the TGA balance increased from $    billion on July   to an expected $    billion by the end of July  Rates in secured markets were  on average  somewhat elevated relative to the average over the previous intermeeting period  owing in part to quarter end effects  Although upward pressure on repo rates was modest at quarter end  take  up at the SRF was $     billion on June    its highest level since the inception of the facility as the addition of an early settlement option seemed to encourage participation  Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed over the intermeeting period  In domestic credit markets  borrowing costs facing businesses  households  and municipalities eased moderately but remained elevated relative to post Global Financial Crisis  GFC  average levels  Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly  while interest rates on small business loans were little changed on net  Rates on    year fixed rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained near the top of the post GFC historical distribution  Interest rates on new auto loans and for new credit card offers have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent months around the upper end of their post GFC distributions  Credit remained generally available  Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations as well as large and middle market private corporations  Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid in June  and private credit continued to be broadly available despite ebbing somewhat in May and June  Loan balances on banks  books increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter  led by growth in commercial and industrial  C&I  loans  Lending to small businesses remained subdued  an outcome attributed to weak borrower demand  Banks in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that  on net  underwriting standards were little changed in the second quarter across most loan categories  although the level of standards remained on the tighter end of their historical range  C&I loan standards  however  were reported to be a little easier than the range seen since       yet still somewhat tighter than in periods not associated with financial stress  Consumer credit continued to be readily available for high credit score borrowers  though growth in applications for home purchases  refinances  auto loans  and revolving credit was relatively weak  reflecting heightened borrowing costs and tighter credit standards for lower credit score borrowers  In the second quarter  credit performance was generally stable but somewhat weaker than pre  pandemic levels  Corporate bond and leveraged loan credit performance declined moderately in May and June  though defaults remained below post GFC medians through June  In the commercial real       estate market  delinquency rates on commercial mortgage backed securities remained elevated through June  The rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to be elevated  By contrast  delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows  In May  the credit card delinquency rate was a little below its year earlier value  while that for auto loans was roughly the same as in May last year  both were elevated relative to their pre pandemic levels  Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on ramp period for student loan payments  The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U S  financial system and  on balance  continued to characterize the system s financial vulnerabilities as notable  The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated  In equity markets  price to earnings ratios stood at the upper end of their historical distribution  while spreads on high yield corporate bonds narrowed notably and were low relative to their historical distribution  Housing valuations edged down but remained elevated  Vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial business and household debt were characterized as moderate  Household debt to GDP was at its lowest level in the past    years  and household balance sheets remained strong  The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained solid  For private firms  debt grew at a rapid pace  while these firms  interest coverage ratios declined to the lower range of their historical distributions  suggesting that vulnerabilities may be growing in that sector  Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable  Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high  while recent annual supervisory stress  test results showed that all participants stayed above minimum capital requirements even under stress conditions  Banks  however  were still seen as more exposed to interest rate risk than had been historically typical  albeit to a lesser degree than was the case earlier in the decade  In the nonbank sector  life insurers  allocation of assets toward private credit and risky assets  funded in part by nontraditional liabilities with short maturities  continued to grow  Leverage and rollover risk at hedge funds remained high and concentrated in the largest firms  Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate  Money market funds  MMFs  continued to be vulnerable to runs  though the aggregate assets of such prime and prime like investment vehicles remained in the middle of their historical range as a fraction of GDP  Prime like alternatives including private liquidity funds  offshore MMFs  and stablecoins have grown rapidly and were noted as relatively less transparent ",

         "Staff Economic Outlook The staff s real GDP growth projection for this year through      was similar to the one prepared for the June meeting  reflecting the offsetting effects of several revisions to the outlook  The staff expected that the rise in the cost of imported goods inclusive of tariffs would be smaller and occur later than in their previous forecast  in addition  financial conditions were projected to be slightly more supportive of output growth  However  these positive influences on the outlook were offset by weaker  than expected spending data and a smaller assumed population boost from net immigration  The staff continued to expect that the labor market would weaken  with the unemployment rate projected to move above the staff s estimate of its natural rate around the end of this year and to remain above the natural rate through       The staff s inflation projection was slightly lower than the one prepared for the June meeting  reflecting the downward revision to the assumed effects of tariffs on imported goods prices  Tariffs were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in       inflation was then projected to decline to   percent by       The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated  primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies  including trade policy  and their associated economic effects  Risks to real activity were judged to remain skewed to the downside in light of the weakening in GDP growth seen so far this year and elevated policy uncertainty  The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside  as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection ",

         "Participants  Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of inflation  many participants observed that overall inflation remained somewhat above the Committee s   percent longer run goal  Participants noted that tariff effects were becoming more apparent in the data  as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation  while services price inflation had continued to slow  A couple of participants suggested that tariff effects were masking the underlying trend of inflation and  setting aside the tariff effects  inflation was close to target  With regard to the outlook for inflation  participants generally expected inflation to increase in the near term  Participants judged that considerable uncertainty remained about the timing  magnitude  and persistence of the effects of this year s increase in tariffs  In terms of timing  many participants noted that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and services prices  Participants cited several contributors to this likely lag  These included the stockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs  slow pass through of input cost increases into       final goods and services prices  gradual updating of contract prices  maintenance of firm customer relationships  issues related to tariff collection  and still ongoing trade negotiations  As for the magnitude of tariff effects on prices  a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs  implying that domestic businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs  Several participants  drawing on information provided by business contacts or business surveys  expected that many companies would increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end customers over time  However  a few participants reported that business contacts and survey respondents described a mix of strategies as being undertaken to avoid fully passing on tariff costs to customers  Such strategies included negotiating with or switching suppliers  changing production processes  lowering profit margins  exerting more wage discipline  or exploiting cost saving efficiency measures such as automation and new technologies  A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms  ability to pass tariff costs into prices  Regarding inflation persistence  a few participants emphasized that they expected higher tariffs to lead only to a one time increase in the price level that would be realized over a reasonably contained period  A few participants remarked that tariff related factors  including supply chain disruptions  could lead to stubbornly elevated inflation and that it may be difficult to disentangle tariff related price increases from changes in underlying trend inflation  Participants noted that longer term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important that they remain so  Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded   percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer term inflation expectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn out effects of higher tariffs on inflation  A couple of participants noted that inflation expectations would likely be influenced by the behavior of the overall inflation rate  inclusive of the effects of tariffs  Various participants emphasized the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that tariff effects did not lead to persistently higher expected and realized inflation  In their discussion of the labor market  participants observed that the unemployment rate remained low and that employment was at or near estimates of maximum employment  Several participants noted that the low and stable unemployment rate reflected a combination of low hiring and low layoffs  Some participants observed that their contacts and business survey respondents had reported being reluctant to hire or fire amid elevated uncertainty  Regarding the outlook for the labor market  some participants mentioned indicators that could suggest a softening in labor demand  These included slower and more concentrated job growth  an increase in cyclically sensitive Black and youth unemployment rates  and lower wage increases of job switchers than job stayers  Some of these participants also noted anecdotes in the Beige Book or in their discussions with contacts that pointed to slower demand  Furthermore  a number of participants noted that softness in aggregate       demand and economic activity may translate into weaker labor market conditions  as could a potential inability of some importers to withstand higher tariffs  Some participants remarked  however  that slower output or employment growth was not necessarily indicative of emerging economic slack because a decline in immigration was lowering both actual and potential output growth as well as reducing both actual payroll growth and the number of new jobs needed to keep the unemployment rate stable  A few participants relayed reports received from contacts that immigration policies were affecting labor supply in some sectors  including construction and agriculture  Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year  driven in large part by slower consumption growth and a decline in residential investment  Several participants stated that they expected growth in economic activity to remain low in the second half of this year  Some participants noted that economic activity would nevertheless be supported by financial conditions  including elevated household net worth  and a couple of participants highlighted stable or low credit card delinquencies  A couple of participants remarked that economic activity would be supported by the resolution of policy uncertainty over time  Regarding the household sector  several participants observed that slower real income growth may be weighing on growth in consumer spending  A few participants noted a weakening in housing demand  with increased availability of homes for sale and falling house prices  As for businesses  several participants remarked that ongoing policy uncertainty had continued to slow business investment  but several observed that business sentiment had improved in recent months  A few participants commented that the agricultural sector faced headwinds due to low crop prices  In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook  participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated  though several participants remarked that there had been some reduction in uncertainty regarding fiscal policy  immigration policy  or tariff policy  Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee s dual mandate  emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment  A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks  while several participants viewed the two risks as roughly balanced  and a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient risk  Regarding upside risks to inflation  participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored  In addition to tariff induced risks  potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums  a more substantial deterioration in the housing market  and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment  In their discussion of financial stability  participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring  Several participants noted concerns about        elevated asset valuation pressures  Regarding banks  a couple of participants commented that  though regulatory capital levels remained strong  some banks continued to be vulnerable to a rise in longer term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets  A few participants commented on vulnerabilities in the market for Treasury securities  raising concerns about dealer intermediation capacity  the increasing presence of hedge funds in the market  and the fragility associated with low market depth  A couple of participants discussed foreign exchange swaps  noting that these served as key sources of dollar funding for foreign financial institutions that lend dollars to their customers in the U S  and abroad  but also that they entailed vulnerabilities due to maturity mismatch and rollover risk  Many participants discussed recent and prospective developments related to payment stablecoins and possible implications for the financial system  These participants noted that use of payment stablecoins might grow following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act  Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U S  Stablecoins Act   They remarked that payment stablecoins could help improve the efficiency of the payment system  They also observed that such stablecoins could increase the demand for the assets needed to back them  including Treasury securities  In addition  participants who commented raised concerns that stablecoins could have broader implications for the banking and financial systems as well as monetary policy implementation  and thus warranted close attention  including monitoring of the various assets used to back stablecoins  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting  participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated  Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year  although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data  Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that the labor market was at or near maximum employment  Participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated  Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent at this meeting  All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings  In considering the outlook for monetary policy  almost all participants agreed that  with the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive  the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments  Participants agreed that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data  the economic outlook  and the balance of risks  Participants assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remained to be seen  They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs  effects on inflation  Even so  some participants emphasized that a        great deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data  helping to inform their assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate  at the same time  some noted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs  effects on inflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy  Some participants stressed that the issue of the persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary policy  Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level  among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was the likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic activity  In discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy  participants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment remained elevated  Participants noted that  if this year s higher tariffs were to generate a larger than  expected or a more persistent than anticipated increase in inflation  or if medium  or longer term inflation expectations were to increase notably  then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case  especially if labor market conditions remained solid  By contrast  if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if inflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored  then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case  Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened  Participants agreed that  if that situation were to occur  they would consider each variable s distance from the Committee s goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close  Participants noted that  in this context  it was especially important to ensure that longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored  Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve s balance sheet  Of those who commented  participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant  They agreed that  with reserves projected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit situation  it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level  A few participants also assessed that  in this environment  abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days  They noted that  if such events created pressures in money markets  the Federal Reserve s existing tools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range  A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementation as        reflected in increased usage at the June quarter end and expressed support for further study of the possibility of central clearing of the SRF to enhance its effectiveness ",

         "Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting  members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data  recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year  Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid  Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated  Members agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate  In support of the Committee s goals  almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent  A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by    basis points at this meeting  These members judged that  excluding tariff effects  inflation was running close to the Committee s   percent objective and that higher tariffs were unlikely to have persistent effects on inflation  Furthermore  they assessed that downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending  and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions  including low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of industries that were less affected by the business cycle  Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  the Committee would carefully assess incoming data  the evolving outlook  and the balance of risks  All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee s   percent objective  Members agreed that  in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook  They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals  Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information  including readings on labor market conditions  inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and financial and international developments  At the conclusion of the discussion  the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  until instructed otherwise  to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive  for release at      p m           Effective July           the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to    Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of    to    percent    Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of     percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $    billion    Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of      percent and with a per counterparty limit of $    billion per day    Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $  billion per month  Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap    Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities  MBS  received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $   billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding    Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments  if needed for operational reasons   The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at      p m    Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data  recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year  The unemployment rate remains low  and labor market conditions remain solid  Inflation remains somewhat elevated  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of   percent over the longer run  Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated  The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate  In support of its goals  the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at    to    percent  In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  the Committee will carefully assess incoming data  the evolving outlook  and the balance of risks  The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities  The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its   percent objective         In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook  The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals  The Committee s assessments will take into account a wide range of information  including readings on labor market conditions  inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and financial and international developments   Voting for this action  Jerome H  Powell  John C  Williams  Michael S  Barr  Susan M  Collins  Lisa D  Cook  Austan D  Goolsbee  Philip N  Jefferson  Alberto G  Musalem  and Jeffrey R  Schmid  Voting against this action  Michelle W  Bowman and Christopher J  Waller  Absent and not voting  Adriana D  Kugler Governors Bowman and Waller preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by   percentage point at this meeting  Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by    basis points to   to    percent in light of inflation moving considerably closer to the Committee s objective  after excluding temporary effects of tariffs  a labor market near full employment but with signs of less dynamism  and slowing economic growth this year  She also expressed her view that taking action to begin moving the policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market  Consistent with the Committee s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at     percent  effective July           The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of     percent  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday Wednesday  September              The meeting adjourned at       a m  on July          ",
